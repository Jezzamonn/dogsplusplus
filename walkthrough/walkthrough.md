## Level 1

Walk to the right and touch the bone, and you'll beat this level :)

## Level 2

There's a dog to the left and the right. Touch them and they'll go on your head. With all three dogs together, you can jump and reach the bone.

## Level 3

There's a dog to the left and the right. Touch them and they'll go on your head. With all three dogs together, you can jump and reach the bone.

## Level 4

Walk to the right, under the block to get to a spiral shape. Stand on the slight ledge, and from there jump up to the dog in the enclave. Then walk both dogs back to the block and press jump twice to make it up to the bone.

## Level 5

First get the dog on your right, and then you can double jump to get the dog above that. Then head to the left and by doubling jumping up you can go to the top ledge. Pick up all the dogs on the way down, then move in front of the bone.

Press up until the highlighted dog is the one at the top. Then double jump and move to the right to pick up the bone.

## Level 6

Head to the right, trying to land on the edge of the platforms first before moving under the blocks. If you lose a dog on the way, you can send one dog back to get it by selecting the top dog in your tower with up, and then doubling jumping to split off. That way you can leave the rest on the dogs at the end.

## Level 7

Jump over the first bone (regular jump, not a double jump), and then double jump to get up to the ledge. You can then get the bone at the top and then get the one at the bottom.

If you accidentally touch the bone, reset the level with R and try again.

## Level 8
Go the right and stand on the edge of the block with a bone. You can then jump to the left and then back to the right to go over the bone. Keep going to the right and pick up the two dogs there, then continue right and up to get the bone at the top of the screen.

Then go all the way to the left and double jump to pick up the extra dog. Then with a regular jump, get the nearby bone. After that you can get the last bone.
